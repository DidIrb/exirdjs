# Express JavaScript Template

This is a template for creating an Express.js application using JavaScript and ESLint. It provides a basic setup to get you started with a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **ESLint**: Linting tool to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter to enforce a consistent style.
- **Nodemon**: Automatically restarts the server on file changes during development.
- **Environment Variables**: Setting up environment variables.



## Get Started

install dependencies change npm based on your package manager of choice eg `pnpm`

```
npm install
```

run test script during development

```
npm run dev
```

Building is not necessary here since the code is written in javascript, though minifying might be required
